# CodeAlpha_DataVisualization
Data Visualization on Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle


## 🎯 Project Objective

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at CodeAlpha**, where I focused on creating meaningful and insightful **data visualizations** to:

- Communicate patterns and trends observed in EDA  
- Transform raw data into compelling **visual formats**  
- Support **data-driven decision-making**  
- Build a **visual portfolio** using Python tools

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

[Link to Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset)

Includes health and lifestyle features like:

- Age, BMI, Blood Pressure  
- Fasting Blood Glucose, HbA1c  
- Cholesterol, Waist Circumference  
- Lifestyle factors (alcohol, smoking, family history)

---

## 🧠 Key Visual Tasks Performed

- ✅ Histograms & KDE plots to analyze distributions (e.g., Age, BMI)  
- ✅ Box plots to compare categories (e.g., BMI vs Family History)  
- ✅ Scatter plots for numerical associations (e.g., HbA1c vs Glucose)  
- ✅ Correlation heatmaps to show relationships  
- ✅ Custom color schemes and labels for clarity

---

## 📈 Tools Used

- Python 🐍  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas  
- Kaggle Notebooks

---

## 📌 Highlights

- Individuals with **family history of diabetes** tend to have **higher BMI**  
- **HbA1c and Fasting Glucose** show strong positive correlation  
- Cholesterol and urate levels exhibit interesting variation across groups  
- Visualization confirms insights from EDA and makes them easier to interpret

## 🔍 Sample Visuals

- 📊 Age & BMI Distribution  
- 📉 BMI vs Diabetes-Linked Factors  
- 📈 Glucose vs HbA1c Scatter  
- 🔥 Feature Correlation Heatmap
